# BlagBox

The ultimate Email, Calendar and Contacts Terminal Client

## Why a Terminal Client?

Well, as developers, we most likely spend a lot of our time in the terminal, so why not have access to our email, calendar and contacts?
Read, reply and delete emails, schedule a meeting from an email or update your contacts in an easy way.

## How can you make it work on the terminal?

Easy! I'm using [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) the best framework to build Terminal applications on Python.

## How do we handle Email, Calendar and Contacts access?

We're using [Nylas](https://www.nylas.com/products/) because I'm a former employee and because it's actually the easiest way to handle communications.

## How this is different from Textual Terminal Email Client?

Well, I wrote [Textual Terminal Email Client](https://github.com/nylas-samples/textual_terminal_email_client) using Nylas V2 API, while I BlagBox from the
scratch using Nylas V3 API. It's better in every sense of the way, with way more features.

## How can I setup my Blagbox?

Just go to the [setup.md](https://github.com/atejada/BlagBox/blob/main/setup.md) page

## What does it looks like?

I'm glad you ask, here are some screenshoots of what you can do in BlagBox.
